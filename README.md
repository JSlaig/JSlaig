- 👋 Hi, I’m @JSlaig, 
      
      Also known as Chechu, and I am a software engineering student from Spain who's
      close to ending his degree. In my university we are mostly trained to be java 
      developers, but we also study different programming languages like C, C++, 
      JavaScript and others less in detail, such as Python, R and M(MatLab's propietary 
      language).

- 👀 I’m interested in... 

      Javascript mostly nowadays due to its versatility, simplicity and freedom in terms 
      on how to approach your code development. This interest was origined on my 3rd degree year 
      where web programming and web applications take an important role. Learning about 
      web apps really opened my mind on how powerful are the tools we have at our 
      disposal to develop online tools.
      
      Also I'm a custom keyboard enthusiast even though I'm pretty much broke for now 😅.
      
      My current build is KBD75v2 with Kailh Speed Copper switches and kinda cheaper
      GMK Olivia clone keycaps.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about...
      
      JavaScript and its different front-end frameworks, also I would like to learn some
      python and maybe dig a little bit into machine learning.
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
  
      Nothing specifically, I mainly want to keep doing own projects to be able to grow my
      abilities on the skills required to be a good software engineer. This doesn't mean 
      that I won't be interested taking part in other projects that I find interesting in 
      the future.
